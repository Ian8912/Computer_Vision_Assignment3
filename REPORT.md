## Part 1

**Question 1.1: The Failure Case Run the original, buggy code with direction=0. Include a screenshot of the incorrect output image.**

Question 1.2: The Investigation Explain the bug. Why does the simple subtraction np.abs(edge_direction - normalized_direction) fail? Describe a specific example with actual angle values (e.g., "If the edge direction is X degrees and the target direction is Y degrees...") that demonstrates the failure. This is the most important part of the report.

Question 1.3: The Fix Provide the line(s) of Python code that you replaced to fix the bug. You only need to show the corrected part.

Question 1.4: The Success Case After fixing the bug, run your corrected function for all four primary directions (direction = 0, 45, 90, 135). Create a single composite image showing these four outputs and include it as a screenshot.
